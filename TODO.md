0) Rename and retitle the page "GrooveLab"
0.5) Make the count-in a 4-count.
0.75) If I change the tempo, it seems to override or not honor the loop setting and play through once even when loop is set to e.g. 2.
1) Add an infinite loop option which continues to loop and collect statistics until the user clicks the play button to stop. It should then display the accuracy visualization. 
2) Add a mechanism to save your accuracy and score over time for different patterns and add a line graph to the UI that shows how you are improving or not improving over time for every loop of the pattern played, with different sessions distinguished in the UI. Update this in realtime as the user plays each iteration of the loop.
3) If the user has a device attached which allows midi-triggering of pad lights (e.g. the MPD-218) then trigger the correct pad light at the time the user should hit that pad.
4) Add a mechanism to deploy to Vercel as a live web application.
5) Add OAuth login with common providers like Google, and save the stats and any other per-user info per-user.
