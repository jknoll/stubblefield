- [ ] **Completion view accuracy offset** - Revisit how timing accuracy is visualized in the piano roll completion view. Currently notes shift based on timeDiff (rushing/dragging), but the effect may be too pronounced at slow BPMs. Options: remove offset entirely, cap the offset, or keep as-is. *Awaiting decision.*
